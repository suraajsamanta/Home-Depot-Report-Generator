# Home-Depot-Report-Generator


I thought it would be fun to create a website that automates the Weekly Report that was manually created every week on most departments within the company.
An example public version of the website is live at: suraajsamanta.pythonanywhere.com


Beforeweek.csv and afterweek.csv are examples of the input CSVs that the website takes.

Out.txt represents what the website automatically returns. 
This report allows business groups to analyze trends in sales, units, and margin and compare the numbers to previous weeks, years, and the predicted forecast.
